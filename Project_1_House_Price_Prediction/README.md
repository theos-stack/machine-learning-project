# 🏠 Project 1: House Price Prediction (Regression)

### 🎯 Project Goal
This project aims to build a **machine learning model** that predicts **house prices** based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and building characteristics using real-world data from **Kaggle**.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

In this project, we will:

1. Load and explore the Kaggle house price dataset  
2. Prepare the data for training (handle missing values, encoding, etc.)  
3. Train and compare two regression models:
   - **Linear Regression**
   - **Random Forest Regressor**
4. Evaluate both models using:
   - **R² Score** — how well the model fits the data  
   - **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** — average prediction error  
5. Visualize and compare model performance
